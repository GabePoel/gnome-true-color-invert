# True Color Window Inverter

**This is a fork of JackKenney/true-color-window-invert due to 2+ years of inactivity on the project**

**Gnome 45**
Is not supported yet, and may not be for a while. I'll be doing my best to port the extension as quickly as possible, but gnome has reworked major parts of their framework, braking many extensions along the way. As a solo developer, i have a lot to look after, so i assure you that work is being made, i just can't say when it'll be done
